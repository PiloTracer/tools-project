# HANDOFF - session boundary

> **This is a template file.** In your adopter repo it is rewritten by **`@session-control start`** / **`@session-control close`** every session. In this framework repo it stays as a demo skeleton so pointer links resolve.

## Session status

**Closed:** 2026-06-25 — Added `prepare-commit-msg` git hook for auto-ref from branch; clarified `auto_prefix_enabled` vs registry flags; added Task Refs section to cursorrules; added readability requirement for commit messages.

**Updated:** 2026-06-25

**Repository state:** Agent OS framework repo (self-hosted). Session-control now supports `commit`/`commit push` (no close) and auto-prepends task refs to commit subjects. GitHub task registry discovery (optional) available for projects with `github_task_registry_enabled`. `scripts/framework-verify.sh` local recovery still pending in Trash.

**Recommended pick-up file:** `.work/plans/NEXT.md`

**Lost or new?** Read `START_HERE.md` (from repo root).

---

## Fresh start - what the next session should do first

1. Run **`@session-control start`** (or follow the manual list in `session-control` skill).
2. Read **`.cursorrules`**.
3. Read **P0 initial scope** when present: `.work/plans/foundation/*-01-*-initial-scope.md`.
4. Read **this file** through §Fresh start, then §Open owner actions.
5. Read `.work/plans/NEXT.md`.
6. Read `.work/plans/ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `RISK_REGISTRY.md`, `UNKNOWNS.md`.

End with **`@session-control close`** (add `commit` / `commit push` only when requested). For mid-session checkpoints use **`@session-control commit`** or **`@session-control commit push`** (no close).

### Conditional reads (customize per project)

| If the task touches… | Read first |

| Any code or new feature | `.ai/standards/*CONVENTIONS*`, `*FEATURE_STANDARD*` |
| External integration | `*-02-*.md`, `.ai/docs/integration/MANIFEST.txt` (if any) |
| Security | `.ai/standards/*threat-model*` |
| Stack / topology | `REPLACE:TECH_STACK_DOC` |
| Master plan / milestones | `.work/plans/full/*-full-plan.md` |
| High-risk feature | Relevant `.work/features/<slug>/*-SPEC.md` |
| Unmapped app surfaces / registry gaps | `@plan-verify coverage` |
